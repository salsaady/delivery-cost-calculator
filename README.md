# Delivery Cost Calculator

A web application that compares the cost of driving to a restaurant versus getting food delivered. The app calculates the driving cost based on the distance between the user's location and the restaurant, fuel consumption of the user's car, and the current gas price, then compares it with the delivery fee.

## Features
